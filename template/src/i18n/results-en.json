    "FacebookMarketplace" : {
      "RadioStar": "I think local second-hand businesses can be negatively impacted as people would prefer not leave their house to sell things. For instance, Goodwill.",
      "Catalyst": "I probably started considering buying second-hand stuff more often. I actually bought a lot of things there when I moved a couple of years ago. I guess that, even already having options like Craigslist available, having something on Facebook brought the concept closer to my reality. I guess it could also create a better sense of local community (which did not really happend to me) and bring people into areas they wouldn't normally go (which happened to me).",
      "Forgotten": "I guess larger cities will always benefit more of these type of online marketplaces, as, based on my use, you are not willing to go too far from home to collect the items. For example, one of the first filters of the search tool is a location and radius of search. Maybe the marketplace could provide an easy to use shipping service that could help people from remote/small localities to participate.",
      "ServiceDog": "I believe people who are going through though moments could use help. So apps like these could have a donation option with incentives for people who can donate their used goods for free."
    },
    "Nextdoor": {
      "RadioStar": "I found Nextdoor to be helpful for referrals. If you want a recommendation on someone to build you a fence or a dog walking service, it's a great resource. In this way, it also helps small and local businesses. People can advertise their services, too. (I think people can advertise anyway! By saying 'hey, I cut hair. Does anyone need a haircut?')",
      "Catalyst": "Nextdoor has helpful features, but I don't log on anymore because every time I do someone is complaining - about the dog owners who don't pick up poop, the black kids who walked into the culdesac, the car that parks across the street from the park at noon everyday. These are all real complaints! It changes how I see my neighborhood because I'm used to see smiling neighbors in person, and it makes me worry that people are more bigoted than I know. It makes me worry for people who don't 'look like they belong to the neighborhood.' And the racism is particularly bad on this last point.",
      "Forgotten": "I would guess that the platform favors homeowners or at least people with more stable living and life style. Renters or other short-term residents are less likely to be invited to join. That gives more power to the older, more stable generation. Plus, I feel like the biggest users are nosy retired people who can stare out their window all day. =P",
      "ServiceDog": "Nextdoor has a problem users othering people, like threatening to call the cops of an unfamiliar person or car is on the neighborhood. A can imagine bad outcomes like a homeless family’s van getting towed while the mom was walking her kids to school. Devastating stuff. I don’t know what Nextdoor could do to rid the site of paranoia, xenophobia, racism, etc. Which is really sad because the platform is supposed to bring people together."

    "Grindr": {
      "RadioStar": "I believe that what is affected  the most is the human's ability to create real bonds.  This requires much more dedication, patience and time. With this app you can skip all this difficult but important part and go straight to the finals, sex.  So the whole work to build maturity and emotional responsibility can be shaken. Anyone who wants to quickly have casual sex can benefit from using the app, but in the long run there is a significant price to be paid.",
      "Catalyst": "This kind of app was widely accepted by the gay community for several reasons, including the ease of satisfying desires more anonymously, without exposure in public environments, for example.  However, it significantly affects the way gays start to relate.  Everyone is much less open to investing in offline relationships and what they demand, creating a community that is less and less accustomed to intimacy, affection and love.",
      "Forgotten": "Anyone who isn't comfortable with casual sex, without intimacy and knowledge of the partner will not be comfortable using the app.  The feeling of being used and discarded usually happens with people who are not comfortable with this type of relationship.  There is a possibility to try to use the app in a less 'straight to the point' way but as it's not the main purpose of the app other users may not like this type of approach.",
      "ServiceDog": "What concerns me most is the trivialization of sex and affective relationships. It meets a human need, sex, excluding any need for bonds and intimacy, which in the long run I believe is harmful for building true relations. Plus, I don't feel comfortable being reduced to photos and a quick chat just to make sex easier. So I would like to see more opportunities and even incentives for people to develop better relationships."
    },
    "Yelp": {
      "RadioStar": "I believe printed advertising who did not manage to switch to online advertising and maybe Tourist information staff were affected by the success of Yelp. Yelp also forces businesses to cater to the average consumer. For example, no one here has any idea what good Indian food is so the reviews are of the places that are least offensive.",
      "Catalyst": "I explore less on my own and I already decide where to go on the basis on an online research before I go out of my house. It made us lazier!",
      "Forgotten": "I think people who are digitally illiterate or who cannot afford having data on their phones are excluded. Also, people that live in areas with poor internet connection and that do not know how to set up an account for their business. In terms of differences of use, I think Yelp is mostly used by North Americans. In Europe, people don't use it as much. In Italy, for example, it is more common to choose a place to go eat because it looks nice when you walk in front of it, not because you found it online.",
      "ServiceDog": "Better serve my community? More checks on false accounts and against discrimination (e.g.: towards businesses owned by people of color). Maybe also indicating whether a business is a small business (with a badge or something of the kind), so people might choose to go there instead of a bigger venue."

    "Uber": {
      "RadioStar": "It seems to me that with Uber's success, the taxi and bus services can be damaged. To add to that, even the human drivers will lost their jobs, since one of the ways Uber will succeed in the future is by reducing human costs and automating transportation with driverless cars.",
      "Catalyst": "Uber has integrated itself as the easy ride home when drunk, and that often serves as its primary purpose. It is also good for a ride to the airport, although cabs are still popular for that in major cities. Most of what I have seen for Uber as a cultural phenomenon rather than intended purpose is people being 'good samaritans' by ordering Ubers for clearly intoxicated people (or to get rid of those people).",
      "Forgotten": "As Uber services is based on smartphone apps, people who are not technologically savvy might not be able to use it. Moreover, I have seen drivers rejecting rides from areas considered shady by them, or with low traffic like industrial areas. That makes the service less available of more expensive for people in those regions.",
      "ServiceDog": "I think Uber could be improved to empower communities, like by designing better security for the passengers, especially women, who are harassed by drivers that now know their phone numbers or at times their place of residence."
    },
    "Lyft": {
      "RadioStar": "It seems to me that with Lyft's success, the taxi and bus services can be damaged. To add to that, even the human drivers will lost their jobs, since one of the ways Lyft plan to succeed in the future is by reducing human costs and automating transportation with driverless cars.",

    "OfferUp": {
      "RadioStar": "This type of online market places might negatively impact local communal efforts, like buynothing; and other small businesses like local markets and thrift stores.",
      "Catalyst": "OfferUp normalizes the selling and buying of used goods in countries where this practice isn't common. That promotes re-use and upcycling of goods which reduces waste and contributes to a better environment.",
      "Forgotten": "I believe most of business is based on localized matching which is more likely to support people living in a larger urban center rather than remote places. And even with OfferUp having shipping option, this extra cost is going to treat unfairly someone living in a rural place.",
      "ServiceDog": "I believe people who are going through though moments could use help. So apps like these could have a donation option with incentives for people who can donate their used goods for free."
    },
    "GoogleMaps": {
      "RadioStar": "Companies providing offline and digital maps have already lost significant market share because Google Maps has become ubiquitous. There is also the side effect that Google Maps shows specific locations, such as restaurants, shops, etc. Business owners who are not listed and do not know how to update their profiles may potentially loose customers who may gravitate towards those that are listed on google maps.",
      "Catalyst": "Google maps has completely changed how directions work in rural areas. While sometimes not correct (and sending people down roads their cars can't handle) in general it means that you don't have to stop and engage to learn where you're going. This is bad for small shops.",
      "Forgotten": "Places with frequently updated maps and local mappers are much more accurate and have latest Google Streetview than those with less frequent updates. And in communities where there might be unpaved or brick roads it is hard to understand the change because of the assumption that a track means some paved road.",
      "ServiceDog": "I believe business owners are more and more dependent in the information shared on platforms like Google Maps, which adds another layer of complexity to small businesses management: to track reviews and make sure people can find them, for instance. Google could have a program to support such businesses and track reviews so no bad actor could damage their surviving chances."

    "PokemonGo": {
      "RadioStar": "I don't think pokemon go replaced any products or services. At first, I would expect it could hurt the sales of pokemon games for consoles like nintendo switch, but some of the new games of the franchise, e.g. pokemon sword and shield had very successful sales numbers. If you streach the concept of the game, though, maybe low-users stopped going to the gym as they consider the daily walks with the game substitute their 'elliptical training'!? =)",
      "Catalyst": "Specially during the summer, I think people are more willing to go outside and walk around parks to play the game; which is a nice and healthy habit. I myself had got back to playing this Summer and had walked much more than when I had paused playing.",
      "Forgotten": "In rural areas there won't be as many pokestops as in urban areas which makes it very hard to play the game. Also, in colder weathers the idea of going outside to catch pokemons doesn't seem very appealing. Finally, on areas where there is a high criminality rate, it is not wise to go outside and walk distractedly with a smartphone on the hand. It would be nice if there were more features that could allow players to have a good experience without having to leave the comfort and safety of their houses.",
      "ServiceDog": "Players have already the opportunity to visit places in their communities that they may have never visited before. I think an improvement would be to not only show pictures of interesting places in the communities but also add more contexts around them. For instance, there are several pokestops on sculptures and buildings in the area I live. It would be helpful to be able to see which artist made those sculptures or when those building were built or any other interesting and educational information."
    },
    "Tinder": {
      "RadioStar": "I believe Tinder had a big impact on other online dating businesses as it attracted the majority of new clients to the App. I can't imagining it taking jobs other than those from employees of these other sites. Romantic consultants? Matchmakers? But I have the impression that Tinder had change the institution of dating for ever. For instance, previously, you'd have to go to bars and other social events to meet people. Not everything is mediated by this App that focus too much on curated photos.",
      "Catalyst": "An app like Tinder, might allow people to expand their social reach to people outside their social circle or even town/city. This could be especially useful to people in recovery, providing opportunities to meet new people outside of spaces like bars and restaurants, which may be some of the few places available to socialize in a rural town (outside of church?). On the flip side, there is also the notion that small towns are tight-knit. Thus, outsourcing social interactions to an app could be disruptive -- reducing in-person social interactions that are foundational to building strong, cohesive rural communities.",
      "Forgotten": "I could see this having differing effects on LGBTQ+, Indigenous, Latinx, and POC community members. While it could expand opportunities for connection amongst these groups, it may also reinforce non-conscious biases that we already see occur among people using dating apps (ex. racial bias in who you choose to swipe left/right on). Also, it may lead to 'outing' of people who may not have come out openly in their own communities. How would a dating app keep these specific users safe from abuse and protect their privacy, especially in a rural community where you often know most people in your community.",
      "ServiceDog": "Dating apps can help people with social anxiety and others who prefer to start relationships based on common interests and indirect conversations to break the ice. Tinders' design is too focused on images, and people who don't feel like sharing that at first fall in disadvantage. So, maybe some filters could be created for people who are interested in richer profiles and conversations."
